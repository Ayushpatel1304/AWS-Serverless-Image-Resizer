# Serverless Image Resizer on AWS

A fully serverless and cost-efficient image resizing solution built on **AWS Lambda** and **Amazon S3**.  
This project automatically resizes images on-the-fly when they are uploaded to an S3 bucket, eliminating the need for manual image processing and reducing storage costs.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Automatic Image Resizing** – Triggered upon file upload.
- **Fully Serverless** – No EC2 instances or manual infrastructure management.
- **Scalable & Cost-Effective** – Pay only for what you use.
- **Multiple Output Sizes** – Generate different sizes from a single original image.
- **S3 Integration** – Stores both original and resized images efficiently.

---

## 🏗 Architecture Overview
1. **User Uploads Image** to the S3 source bucket.
2. **S3 Event Trigger** activates an AWS Lambda function.
3. **Lambda Function** resizes the image to pre-defined dimensions using `sharp` (or similar library).
4. **Resized Images** are stored in a separate destination S3 bucket or a subdirectory.

## 📦 Tech Stack
- **AWS Lambda** – Serverless compute for image processing
- **Amazon S3** – Object storage for original and resized images
- **Amazon CloudWatch** – Logging and monitoring
- **Node.js** – Lambda runtime (with Sharp image processing library)

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have:
- An **AWS account**
- **AWS CLI** configured locally
- **Node.js** and **npm** installed
- IAM permissions to create S3 buckets, Lambda functions, and related resources
